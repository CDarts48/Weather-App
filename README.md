# Weather-App

**Motivation**
Aside from this being assigned this app as a project my motivation to build this was to get a good understanding of making a weather app so I can in the future track snow and surf reports with my app.

**Problems Solved**
Sometimes I can’t look outside in a different city in order to see what the weather is like, so this app solves the problem of not knowing weather in another city.  
 
**Lessons Learned**
I learned API calls and Servers which will help me build more robust apps.

**How To Use**
In the top right there is a text box where you can enter the city’s name and click enter this app will then give you the current weather and a 5 day forecast. You can add more cities and they will be saved on the left side of the screen and if you click on a previously searched city that cities weather will repopulate the displays.

**Future Work**
Add Surf and Ski reports. Git rid of the search button as it’s superfluous.

**Technology Used**
HTML CSS JavaScript API 

**Assistance**
I was assisted in this project by my tutors from the bootcamp. I also ran the code through both the xpert learning assist and github copilot.
